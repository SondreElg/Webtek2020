Three things you liked about the website {
    Newsfeed was cool for this course
        Could make it dynamic
    Screenings was nice
        Like the popups
    
}

Three things you didn't like about the website {
    Voting wasn't very intuitive
        The way things move make it seem like the one you move move back
    Website doesn't change when you "sign up"
