    Voting is pretty nice and "oversiktlig"

Three things you didn't like about the website? {
    "Display all news" in newsfeed didn't give clear feedback
    Didn't feel like the way he found information about anime was "the right way"
        Would like a catalogue of what anime we have and will watch
    Unclear if the ordering on the votings page was the most popular order or "intended order" 
        Perhaps don't have numbers from the beginning
        Click on anime in the order you'd rank them
        Can drag afterwards
