                Anime NTNU is a student organization for people fond of anime
                (Japanese animation). They host open screenings of anime at
                Gløshaugen weekly.
            </p>

            <section>
                <header><h3>Frontpage</h3></header>
                <p>
                    Regarding the design of the front page, we have made the
                    appearance of the page fairly similar to the design
                    specified in P2: Project Design. A small difference in
                    design is that all the title headers are placed above the
                    sections, with a white border at the bottom clearly
                    separating the title header from its corresponding section.
                    This change was implemented to highlight each section, and
                    was implemented across the entire website for consistency.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also wanted the users to be able to look up more news
                    items or information about screenings from the “latest news”
                    section and the “next screening” section on the front page.
                    We did so by making the title headers for these sections
                    clickable. By clicking on the title headers, the users will
                    be redirected to each of the title header’s respective
                    pages. To highlight that the title headers are clickable, we
                    implemented an on hover effect that changes the background
                    color of the title header.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <header><h3>Screenings</h3></header>
                <p>
                    For screenings, a small change we originally made was the
                    format of the date. This was both because the new format
                    offers less ambiguity regarding which date it is, and it was
                    easier to work with. One big change made after user testing
                    is that Screenings is now split into two sections; “Shows of
                    the semester” and “Upcoming screenings”. This is due to many
                    responses regarding confusion about finding what anime is
                    being screened this semester. “Shows of the semester”
                    details what anime will be screened during the current
                    semester, and when and where they will normally take place.
                    Below this, “Screenings” have been renamed to “Upcoming
                    screenings” to clear confusion about why only future
                    screenings are being shown. Lastly, we’ve added an indicator
                    that you’ve reached the end of the screenings at the bottom
                    of the page. This could help clear confusion between the end
                    of the semester and when the next series are voted in, in
                    which no screenings will be loaded in.
                </p>

            <section>
                <header><h3>Voting</h3></header>
                <p>
                    Instead of having thumbnails for each anime in the voting
                    list, we decided to use only text (the name of the anime and
                    its year of release). We made this decision because this
                    list can be quite long - in our example, there are 12
                    options to rank. This is a representative number, judging
                    from voting rounds performed in real-life scenarios prior
                    semesters. Thumbnails usually require large amounts of space
                    on the screen to be recognizable. In order to keep the list
                    manageable and to keep it easy to drag and drop, we decided
                    not to use thumbnails.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also decided to deviate slightly from our suggested color
                    scheme. Instead of having the submit button dark like in the
                    mockup (figure 12 of P2), we instead opted for a brighter
                    color, so the button would be easily visible. We also chose
                    to omit the white arrows on the left-hand side of each list
                    item, because we deemed this to be a distraction. Instead,
                    we added textual instructions on the top of the page.
                    However, user testing indicates that such an icon could
                    potentially be beneficial, because it could provide an
                    indicator that the items can indeed be dragged and dropped.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <header><h3>Newsfeed</h3></header>
                <p>
                    The design of the newsfeed is almost identical to the one
                    specified in P2. At the request of the client, we decided to
                    import all previous newsfeed items posted on the Anime NTNU
                    website. This is to allow the user to access information
                    given before the creation of the website, as well as to keep
                    an archive of old news items. Amongst the old news posts,
                    there were a lot of dead links, so we removed these.
                    Furthermore, the page now loads only some of the newsfeed
                    items, and keeps loading more as the user scrolls down.
                    We’ve also added an indicator making it clear for the user
                    that they’ve reached the end of the page.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <header><h3>Popups</h3></header>
                <p>
                    The popups were kept very close to the initial mockup in P2.
                    The only major difference is that the anime pop-ups will use
                    a scrollbar for long descriptions to prevent the box from
                    growing bigger than the screen. Also, clicking the popup
                    background will now also close the popup. The same
                    functionality was implemented on the signup popup for
                    consistency.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <header><h3>Navigation bar</h3></header>
                <p>
                    There have been some changes in the navigation bar that
                    deviates from the design from P2. In our design, we intended
                    for the navigation links to be centered on the bar. This was
                    changed so that the navigational links are aligned to the
                    right instead. Considering all the elements on the
                    navigation bar, we thought this would contribute to a
                    cleaner and more user friendly experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The “Sign up” button has also been changed to have the same
                    flat design as the rest of the menu items. The color of the
                    button is the same as in the sandwich menu. We did this to
                    increase the clickable area of the button, as well as
                    keeping consistency between buttons and between the sandwich
                    and non-sandwich navigation bars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On the sandwich menu, the background color of the “Sign up”
                    button and the “Our discord server” button has been changed
                    to a lighter blue color. Originally, the color was supposed
                    to be the same as the navy blue color used on the sections.
                    We later realized (when testing on a smaller screen) that
                    the background color of the buttons would overlap with the
                    background color of the content, which made it hard to see
                    where the buttons stopped and the content started.
                </p>

                <header><h3>Javascript</h3></header>
                <p>
                    For implementing popups, we initially planned having only
                    ‘popupNotification.js’ for synopsis popups and
                    ‘becomeMember.js’ for the signup popup. However, we found
                    that there was quite a bit of functionality that could be
                    generalized between the two different popup types on the
                    site (synopsis popups and the signup popup). We decided to
                    put this common functionality in a file named
                    ‘utilsPopup.js’.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ‘showScreenings.js’ is used single-handedly to display the
                    first upcoming screening on the frontpage and on all
                    upcoming screenings on the screenings page. Based on
                    feedback from user testing, it has been adapted to show
                    which anime is shown the current semester as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ‘anime.js’ contains information about the anime which will
                    be screened the current semester. We added this to have
                    actual content on out site. We chose to put this information
                    in JavaScript objects, to overcome the limitation of using
                    neither databases nor JSON.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ‘showNews.js’ is used to display the latest news post on the
                    frontpage, and load all news on the newsfeed page. We added
                    a separate script, 'news.js', for containing all the news
                    items without databases or JSON.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <header><h3>Mobile responsiveness</h3></header>
                <p>
                    Although not a requirement, we made sure that the website
                    looks good on mobile devices. This was achieved with the use
                    of media queries in CSS, flexboxes, and the viewport metatag
                    in HTML.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We planned to have the navigation bar change appearance on
                    narrow screens, but we ultimately found it helpful to make
                    other components more responsive as well. The most notable
                    was the layout of the frontpage. Our initial mockup of this
                    page shows three sections: 'Welcome', centered on top;
                    'Latest news' below to the left hand side; and 'Next
                    screening' below 'Welcome' and to the right hand side. On
                    narrow screens, the two bottom sections became too narrow to
                    be of much use. Therefore, we designed the page so that on
                    narrow screens, the three sections are laid out directly
                    below each other in a single column.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, on narrow screens, some synopses would be so
                    large that the close button on the popup would be outside
                    the clickable window. To mitigate this, we made the
                    background behind the popup clickable, so that when it is
                    clicked, the popup closes.
                </p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <header><h3>Other</h3></header>
                <p>
                    All thumbnails were given more descriptive names instead of
                    ‘thumbnail_1.png’, ‘thumbnail_2.png’ and so on.
                    Additionally, we added two icons, ‘envelope-solid.svg’ and
                    ‘user-solid.svg’, to use in the signup popup. We also
                    created a favicon based on the new logo.

        <section>
            <header><h2>Modularity</h2></header>
            <p>
                We have implemented modularity through a variety of javascript
                files that can be used on several pages. For navigating between
                the pages on the website, we made a script for the navigation
                bar, ‘navbar.js’. We made a function that gets id=”navbar” that
                is included in all the HTML files, and appends the HTML-elements
                for the navigation bar in the HTML files with inner.HTML and
                DOM. The link to the navbar.js script is also included in the
                HTML-files.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scripts showScreenings.js and anime.js are used on both the
                screenings page and the front page. Lastly, the showNews.js and
                news.js are used on both the newsfeed page and the front page.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are also several functions that can be used for popups in
                general. There are two different types of popups currently on
                the website: Synopsis popups, appearing when the user clicks an
                anime; and a signup popup, appearing when the user clicks the
                ‘sign up’ button. The signup popup can be accessed from every
                page, and the synopsis popups can be accessed from the frontpage
                and the screenings page. The script ‘utilsPopup.js’ contains
                functions for initializing, creating, and closing popups in
                general.
            </p>
            <p>
                By implementing the same scripts in HTML-files that needed the
                same functionalities, we kept the amount of duplicated code to a
                bare minimum.

                Maja made the voting page which uses a javascript, voting.js, to
                rearrange a list of items in a desired sequence. Upon submitting
                the sequenced list, the page will reload and the list will go
                back to its default ordering. She also implemented modularity
                for the navigation bar

                Tobias wrote ‘becomeMember.js’ that creates a pop-up
                notification containing a signup form. The form requires the
                user to fill out a name and email before submitting. A change
                made to ‘becomeMember.js’ was the inclusion of alerting the user
                that the signup submission was received.

                Aleksander wrote ‘popupNotification.js’ that creates a pop-up
                notification containing title, thumbnail, and synopsis of an
                anime. The intended use case is the user clicking an anime,
                either on the front page or on the screenings page. He also
                created ‘utilsPopup.js’, a small utility script with functions
                common to both the synopsis popups and the signup popup.

                Sondre achieved the 'Latest news' requirement in 'news.js' and
                'showNews.js'. 'news.js' contains a list of all news items,
                while 'showNews.js' consists of two functions: one to display
                all news, and one to display only the latest news items.

                As our client did not specify a specific font or font-style when
                designing the website, we chose a font which we thought would be
                suitable for the website. The font we chose was Open Sans, which
                can be found
                <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans">here</a>.
                This font is from Google Fonts. The fallback font used on the
                website is Sans Serif.
