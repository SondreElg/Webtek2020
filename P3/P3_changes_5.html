            <p>Client: The client is Anime NTNU</p>

                Contact person: Bernt Johan Damslora, previous leader of Anime
                NTNU

            <p>
                Anime NTNU is a student organization for people fond of anime
                (Japanese animation). They host open screenings of anime at
                Gl√∏shaugen weekly.

            <p>
                <span class="list_title">Voting.html</span> - Instead of having
                thumbnails for each anime in the voting list, we decided to use
                only text (the name of the anime and its year of release). We
                made this decision because this list can be quite long - in our
                example, there are 12 options to rank. This is a representative
                number, judging from voting rounds performed in real-life
                scenarious prior semesters. Thumbnails usually require large
                amounts of space on the screen to be recognizable. In order to
                keep the list managable and to keep it easy to drag and drop, we
                decided not to use thumbnails.
            </p>
            <p>
                We also decided to deviate slightly from our suggested color
                scheme. Instead of having the submit button dark like in the
                mockup (figure 12 of P2), we instead opted for a brighter color,
                so as to have the button be easily visible. Finally, we chose to
                omit the white arrows on the left-hand side of each list item,
                because in the end we deemed this to be a distraction. Instead,
                we added textual instruction on the top of the page.

                    <span class="list_title">Screenings</span> - Sondre wrote
                    'showScreenings.js', containing multiple functions to
                    generate screening information. The function
                    'generateNextScreening' is used to display the next
                    screening on the front page, with the given anime titles.

                    <span class="list_title">Pop-up information</span> -
                    Aleksander implemented a function for showing a popup with
                    information about an anime, given a title, description, and
                    a thumbnail image URL. Sondre connected this script so that
                    when a user clicks an anime box, this popup will appear.

                <li>
                    <span class="list_title">Latest news</span> - Sondre
                    achieved the 'Latest news' requirement in 'news.js' and
                    'showNews.js'. 'news.js' contains a list of all news items,
                    while 'showNews.js' consists of two functions: one to
                    display all news, and one to display only the latest news
                    items.
