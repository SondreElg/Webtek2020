            <p>
                Anime NTNU is a student organization for people fond of anime
                (Japanese animation). They host open screenings of anime at
                Gløshaugen weekly.

            <header><h2>Purpose, goals, and audience</h2></header>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to promote Anime NTNU and recruit
                new members. It should be easier for potential new members, as
                well as established members, to look up screenings. The website
                should also have a clear layout and be made in such a way that
                it is intuitive to use by both old and new members. In this
                context, the website should provide a good solution for sorting
                the information being displayed on the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                The audience is all people fond of or curious about anime. As
                Anime NTNU is a voluntary student organization at NTNU, the main
                portion of the audience will consist of students at NTNU. Most
                visitors will therefore be young, which means we can keep the
                font size small in favor of other content. Furthermore, those
                who visit the website are most likely looking for information
                about Anime NTNU itself or their screenings. This is why we have
                made the decision of having a front page with different
                elements, showcasing the information that would be the most
                relevant for the audience. Lastly, Anime NTNU has a record of
                attracting international students and the site will therefore be
                made in English.

            <header><h2>Navigation structure</h2></header>
            <p>
                The navigational structure of the new Anime NTNU website is
                visualized in figure 1. Initially, the first page one can see
                when visiting Anime NTNU’s website is the frontpage. And from
                here, the visitor will be able to access all of the pages
                included in the website. This is possible through the use of a
                navbar. In addition, the visitor will be able to go back to the
                front page from every page by clicking on the logo in the
                navbar.
            </p>
            <p>
                We chose to implement this type of interactive design because we
                wish to give the visitor as much freedom as possible within the
                website. We also wish to encourage visitors of Anime NTNU to
                further check out specific content on the website. For example,
                from the front page the visitor will be able to see the time and
                date, as well as the title of the anime which will be showcased
                on the next screening hosted by Anime NTNU. If the visitor
                clicks on the featured screening, the visitor will be redirected
                to the screenings page. If the visitor does not click on the
                featured screening but becomes curious about other future
                screenings, the visitor can easily access this type of
                information by interacting with the navbar.

            <h3>Front page</h3>
            <p>
                The front page is the first page the visitor sees when they
                visit the website. The content consists of three separate
                sections as shown in figure 2. The section on top is a textbox
                containing a bit of information about Anime NTNU and welcoming
                the visitor to their website. The section on the left side of
                the screen will showcase the latest news from the newsfeed page,
                and the section on the right side of the screen will showcase
                upcoming screenings from the screenings page. The sections will
                have a blue background color (#1F293C) that is lighter than the
                color of the main body. We want this content to be available
                from the front page as this is the type of information we expect
                most visitors will be interested in. It might also make the
                visitor curious about the rest of the website, and prompt them
                to check out other pages. We want the website to have a clear
                and intuitive design that prompts the visitor to explore and
                interact with the different pages.

                store our files, as well as a work division table to assign
                people tasks and keep track of internal deadlines.

                All of the following files will be in a common folder which will

                project.
