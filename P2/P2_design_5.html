            <p>
                Anime NTNU is a student organization for people fond of anime
                (Japanese animation). They host open screenings of anime at
                Gløshaugen weekly.

            <header><h2>Purpose, goals, and audience</h2></header>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to promote Anime NTNU and recruit
                new members. It should be easier for potential new members, as
                well as established members, to look up screenings. The website
                should also have a clear layout and be made in such a way that
                it is intuitive to use by both old and new members. In this
                context, the website should provide a good solution for sorting
                the information being displayed on the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                The audience is all people fond of or curious about anime. As
                Anime NTNU is a voluntary student organization at NTNU, the main
                portion of the audience will consist of students at NTNU. Most
                visitors will therefore be young, which means we can keep the
                font size small in favor of other content. Furthermore, those
                who visit the website are most likely looking for information
                about Anime NTNU itself or their screenings. This is why we have
                made the decision of having a front page with different
                elements, showcasing the information that would be the most
                relevant for the audience. Lastly, Anime NTNU has a record of
                attracting international students and the site will therefore be
                made in English.

            <header><h2>Navigation structure</h2></header>
            <p>
                The navigational structure of the new Anime NTNU website is
                visualized in figure 1. Initially, the first page one can see
                when visiting Anime NTNU’s website is the frontpage. And from
                here, the visitor will be able to access all of the pages
                included in the website. This is possible through the use of a
                navbar. In addition, the visitor will be able to go back to the
                front page from every page by clicking on the logo in the
                navbar.
            </p>
            <p>
                We chose to implement this type of interactive design because we
                wish to give the visitor as much freedom as possible within the
                website. We also wish to encourage visitors of Anime NTNU to
                further check out specific content on the website. For example,
                from the front page the visitor will be able to see the time and
                date, as well as the title of the anime which will be showcased
                on the next screening hosted by Anime NTNU. If the visitor
                clicks on the featured screening, the visitor will be redirected
                to the screenings page. If the visitor does not click on the
                featured screening but becomes curious about other future
                screenings, the visitor can easily access this type of
                information by interacting with the navbar.

            <header><h2>Page layout and appearance</h2></header>
            <p>
                We have tried coming up with an universal design which will be
                applied to all the pages on the website. Both the design and
                choice of styling was made in collaboration with our client. We
                made a tentative design and were able to receive immediate
                feedback from our client stating his opinions. We then
                implemented changes from the suggestions he proposed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Anime NTNU is catering towards a younger audience, we made
                some specific design choices which we think results in a website
                that has a clean layout and a friendly user interface. This will
                greatly affect how much the visitors will be using the website
                as well as how much time they will want to spend on the website.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main color scheme of the website is fairly dark, with the
                text having an offset white color. As we are expecting a younger
                audience we believe a website with such a color palette will
                make for a better viewing experience, especially with dark-mode
                being a popular and widely used feature amongst young people
                nowadays. This also goes well with the mood Anime NTNU wishes to
                convey through their website.

                <p>
                    The front page is the first page the visitor sees when they
                    visit the website. The content consists of three separate
                    sections as shown in figure 2. The section on top is a
                    textbox containing a bit of information about Anime NTNU and
                    welcoming the visitor to their website. The section on the
                    left side of the screen will showcase the latest news from
                    the newsfeed page, and the section on the right side of the
                    screen will showcase upcoming screenings from the screenings
                    page. The sections will have a blue background color
                    (#1F293C) that is lighter than the color of the main body.
                    We want this content to be available from the front page as
                    this is the type of information we expect most visitors will
                    be interested in. It might also make the visitor curious
                    about the rest of the website, and prompt them to check out
                    other pages. We want the website to have a clear and
                    intuitive design that prompts the visitor to explore and
                    interact with the different pages.

                <header><h3>Navigation bar</h3></header>
                <p>
                    The navigation bar will be placed at the top of the screen
                    of each page on the website. From here, the visitor can
                    easily navigate between the different pages, fulfilling the
                    purpose of visitors wishing to view more information about
                    particular topics not shown on the front page. On the far
                    left of the navigation bar there will be a logo representing
                    Anime NTNU which can be clicked on to navigate the visitor
                    back to the front page. Our client has also requested there
                    to be a clickable link which redirects the user to Anime
                    NTNU’s discord server. The client specifically wished for
                    this link to be available from the navigation bar. The link
                    will be displayed as an interactive picture. The client also
                    wanted there to be a feature which lets the visitor sign up
                    to become a member of Anime NTNU. This feature will be
                    implemented as a button (as shown in figure 3) that OnClick
                    opens a pop-up form prompting the visitor to submit an
                    username and a password. Both the interactive discord
                    picture and the sign up button is placed in the navigation
                    bar because we want the visitor to be able to reach these
                    features easily whenever and wherever from the website.

                    The visitor will be able to receive visual feedback on where
                    they are through a slightly darker background color
                    (#202020) on the active page.

                    Although there is no requirement for a mobile version of the
                    website, we have created a mockup-image displaying how the
                    navigation bar will look on a mobile device. For devices
                    with smaller screens such as a mobile, the navigation bar
                    will be interactive through a sandwich menu. To keep the
                    navigation bar clean and spaced, we will only display the
                    logo and the sandwich menu to begin with. By clicking on the
                    sandwich menu, the links to the pages and features will be
                    rolled over as shown in figure 6.

                    will use the same color scheme as the pages on the website.
                    The pop-up form will have two fields the visitor must fill
                    out in order to submit their application to become a member
                    of Anime NTNU. If the visitor clicks on the “sign up” button

                    From the screenings page the visitor will be able to view
                    all upcoming screenings hosted by Anime NTNU. As there might
                    be several screenings scheduled for the same day, the
                    screenings will be grouped together in a list format. Each
                    planned screening-session will contain information about the
                    date, time, and location of the screening, making this
                    important piece of information easily viewable. All the
                    planned screenings on the page will have a thumbnail picture
                    of said screening. This thumbnail picture can be clicked on
                    to display additional information about the anime.

                    When clicking on a thumbnail picture on the screenings page,
                    a pop-up box containing additional information about that
                    screening will be displayed. This pop-up box contains the
                    name of the anime being screened, the thumbnail picture, and
                    a general description of the anime. This feature will be
                    implemented through a Javascript function. When the visitor
                    is finished reading about the anime, they can exit the
                    pop-up by clicking on the “X” in the upper right corner.

                <p>
                    The voting page is the page where the visitor will be able
                    to cast their vote to decide which animes will be screened
                    the upcoming semester. Throughout the semester, the visitors
                    will be able to rearrange a list of animes according to
                    which anime they would like to watch the most. The animes in
                    the list is a selection made by Anime NTNU. The list will
                    have a drag and drop feature, making it possible for the
                    viewer to easily drag animes to the correct position in the
                    list. The result can then be submitted to Anime NTNU through
                    a “submit” button. The voting page is an important part of
                    the new Anime NTNU website as it enables Anime NTNU to
                    adjust the screenings according to the visitors interests.
                    This might also help Anime NTNU increase their member base
                    and amount of visitors as they will be able to get valid
                    feedback on what people actually want to watch.

                We have created a tentative organizational scheme to create and
                store our files, as well as a work division table to assign
                people tasks and keep track of internal deadlines.
