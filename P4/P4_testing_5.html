                Part of our user testing consisted of sending a survey to likely
                members of our target audience. Below are the questions used in
                the survey.
            </p>

                    but not at NTNU; not a student)
                </li>
                <li>Have you been to one of Anime NTNU's screenings?</li>

            <header><h2>Tester Audience</h2></header>
            <p>
                For testing, we performed both surveying with a web form, and
                live user testing. A Google Form was sent to members of Anime
                NTNU and other groups of interest. For user testing, the group
                members contacted friends and acquaintances, gave them some
                questions and tasks, and observed their responses. In total, 13
                responses from the webform were submitted, and 8 live tests were
                performed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Considering that Anime NTNU is a student organization, the
                target audience consists mainly of students. This has been
                reflected in our testing procedure, considering that all the
                people participating in live testing and the majority of webform
                submitters were students.

            <p>
                We were able to run tests with a variety of platforms and web
                browsers. The platforms covered were Windows 10, Mac, and
                mobile. Among the web browsers used were Google Chrome,
                Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Vivaldi.

            <p>
                In addition to the digital schema we sent out, we conducted
                eight live tests where we observed how a test person interacted
                with the website. The test person chose their unit and browser
                of preference and tested different features and functionalities
                available on the website. As we live tested quite a lot of
                people, we would like to highlight the testing procedure and
                feedback received from two of the testers. At the end of this
                section, we will briefly state the overall issues, opinions and
                feedback received from all the live tests.
            </p>
            <p>The tasks performed in the live testing were the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How can you contact Anime NTNU?</li>
                <li>Find information about the first upcoming screening.</li>
                <li>What anime are being watched this semester?</li>
                <li>When is the last screening of the semester?</li>
                <li>What anime were being watched in the fall of 2013?</li>
                <li>Vote for which anime you would like to watch.</li>
                <li>What is Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei about?</li>
                <li>What is Anime NTNU?</li>
                <li>Create a user.</li>
                <li>How can you attend screenings?</li>

                    This person was able to navigate to the desired elements
                    very quickly. They used the navigation bar extensively. They
                    immediately understand how to arrange the elements in the
                    voting list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They explained that they found it easy to find information,
                    they found the voting page practical, and they thought it
                    was positive that information about all upcoming screenings
                    was published. However, they found it impractical that they
                    had to join the Discord server to find more information.
                    They were uncertain in which order the episodes were shown.
                    They also wanted the ability to show voting results.
