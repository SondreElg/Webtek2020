                Anime NTNU is a student organization for people fond of anime
                (Japanese animation). They host open screenings of anime at
                Gløshaugen weekly.

                Part of our user testing consisted of sending a survey to likely
                members of our target audience. Below are the questions used in
                the survey.

            <header><h2>Tester audience</h2></header>
            <p>
                For testing, we performed both surveying with a web form, and
                live user testing. A Google Form was sent to members of Anime
                NTNU and other groups of interest. For user testing, the group
                members contacted friends and acquaintances, gave them some
                questions and tasks, and observed their responses. In total, 13
                responses from the webform were submitted, and 8 live tests were
                performed.
            </p>
            <p>
                Considering that Anime NTNU is a student organization, the
                target audience consists mainly of students. This has been
                reflected in our testing procedure, considering that all the
                people participating in live testing and the majority of webform
                submitters were students.

                We were able to run tests with a variety of platforms and web
                browsers. The platforms covered were Windows 10, Mac, and
                mobile. Among the web browsers used were Google Chrome,
                Microsoft Edge, Firefox, Safari, and Vivaldi.

            <p>
                In addition to the digital schema we sent out, we conducted
                eight live tests where we observed how a test person interacted
                with the website. The test person chose their unit and browser
                of preference and tested different features and functionalities
                available on the website. As we live tested quite a lot of
                people, we would like to highlight the testing procedure and
                feedback received from two of the testers. At the end of this
                section, we will briefly state the overall issues, opinions and
                feedback received from all the live tests.
            </p>
            <p>The tasks performed in the live testing were the following:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>How can you contact Anime NTNU?</li>
                <li>Find information about the first upcoming screening.</li>
                <li>What anime are being watched this semester?</li>
                <li>When is the last screening of the semester?</li>
                <li>What anime were being watched in the fall of 2013?</li>
                <li>Vote for which anime you would like to watch.</li>

                </header>
                <p>
                    This person was able to navigate to the desired elements
                    very quickly. They used the navigation bar extensively. They
                    immediately understand how to arrange the elements in the
                    voting list.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They explained that they found it easy to find information,
                    they found the voting page practical, and they thought it
                    was positive that information about all upcoming screenings
                    was published. However, they found it impractical that they
                    had to join the Discord server to find more information.
                    They were uncertain in which order the episodes were shown.
                    They also wanted the ability to show voting results.

                <header><h3>Test person using a Mac with Safari</h3></header>
                <p>
                    This user was very quick to use the navbar and always found
                    the correct pages for each question after a single click.
                    There was some confusion regarding the content on some of
                    the pages and how to interact with it though.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When they were tasked to find an old news post on the
                    newsfeed page, they clicked the “Show all news”-button a
                    total of 4 times before they realized all news had been
                    loaded in. Furthermore, when tasked with finding what anime
                    are being screened this semester, they went through both
                    “Screenings” and “Newsfeed” before concluding with “It’s
                    different”, not being certain what anime was being screened
                    throughout the semester.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the tasks they commented a lot on the overall design
                    of the website, describing it as straightforward to use and
                    minimalistic. They also thought it was nice how it was clear
                    what elements were clickable. On the other hand, they found
                    it confusing that the list on the voting page reset after
                    submitting their votes, suggesting that they should stay as
                    submitted.

                <p>
                    Some of the live tests uncovered that how to vote was
                    unclear. One user tried clicking an element and awaiting
                    response, and then pressing the submit button and clicking
                    ‘OK’ on the subsequent prompt. They performed these actions
                    for a few repetitions, before finally reading the textual
                    instructions on the top of the page and thereby discovering
                    that the elements could be dragged and dropped.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall, among the eight live testers, there were a few
                    recurring issues. In particular, finding information on how
                    to attend a screening seemed to be unclear. Several users
                    navigated to the screenings page, containing the time and
                    location of the screenings, but it was unclear that this was
                    the information they needed. They tried clicking the popup
                    containing only the summary, following by closing the popup
                    and navigating elsewhere to the site. It is apparent that
                    this information could be relayed clearer, for example via a
                    small text description on the front page and/or the
                    screenings page.

                <p>
                    Users seemed to agree in large that the front page was
                    helpful. Finding information about screenings and news
                    seemed to not be an issue for the most part. Most users
                    commented positively on ease of navigation. Praise was also
                    given to the synopsis popups, and pointed out that such a
                    solution was much better than being navigated to a separate
                    page.

                <p>
                    Opinions about the overall design were largely differing.
                    Some users commented that the design was easy on the eyes
                    and left an appropriate amount of spacing between elements.
                    Others said they did not like the colors, and that the
                    navigation bar was too small on a phone. We also received
                    feedback that the sign up button was too different compared
                    to the rest of the menu items.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As discussed in the section about observed testing, the
                    process of voting was criticized. Both in the live testing
                    and the survey, we received feedback that finding out how to
                    vote was not trivial. One user also noted the lack of voting
                    results.

            <header><h2>Response to feedback</h2></header>
            <p>
                Some of the feedback collected was used to further develop the
                website before the deadline, and these changes have been
                mentioned in P3. For example, many users struggled finding
                information about which anime is being screened this semester.
                The screenings page was updated to list this explicitly. We also
                changed the signup button to be more stylistically similar to
                the rest of the menu items.
            </p>
            <p>
                As described earlier, there seemed to be a lack of clarity in
                some cases regarding how to vote for which anime a user wants to
                watch. This problem could be (partially or completely) solved
                with the following measures:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Create a visual indication, like an icon for every list
                    element, indicating that the elements can be dragged
                </li>
                <li>
                    Shorten the text explanation, or add a shorter but
                    physically larger element of text saying for example “Drag
                    and drop to vote”
                </li>
                <li>
                    After voting, the user should be informed that their votes
                    have been submitted
                </li>
            </ul>

                In addition, the voting page was known not to work in Firefox
                and on touch devices. This is reflected in the responses from
                the corresponding question on the survey.

                There were many who commented on how our site only provided
                Discord as a means to contact Anime NTNU. Although we wanted to
                address this issue, Anime NTNU as an organization has no other
                means of contacting them, so there was little we could do.

                    During this project I have learned the importance of good
                    communication and teamwork, especially considering the
                    current circumstances. Due to all the group members having
                    different time schedules in addition to the ongoing
                    pandemic, we have been relying a lot on digital platforms
                    for communication and sharing work. We have for example been
                    using Git and Github to work on the same project, making it
                    easy and efficient to get the project up-to-date. This was
                    mainly possible due to the team members prior knowledge in
                    these technologies and platforms, however, I still do not
                    think it would have been easy had we not been constantly
                    requesting updates and feedback from each other.

                    I have also gained more experience using Javascript during
                    this project. I have used Javascript before, but I have
                    never made a drag-and-drop poll like I did for the voting
                    page. This was a challenge in itself, and I realised, after
                    making it, that we could have looked at other options for
                    the voting system, as the one I implemented into the website
                    is not functional on touch screens.

                    Lastly, I have learned a lot about working in a project with
                    a real client. Having worked with a real client made me
                    realise the importance of thinking about what you are making
                    and who you are making it for. This was made apparent after
                    receiving feedback from the client in the design process as
                    well as when implementing the actual features on the
                    website.

                    I have learned how-to plan a website and the importance of
                    properly planning a website before production. There are
                    many aspects of producing a website that I never would’ve
                    thought of if they were not specified in the project
                    deliverables. By specifying many of the production stages
                    and elements of a webpage, the production of said elements
                    also became much easier. I have also seen the importance of
                    user testing, and how the general consensus of the testers
                    may differ from our own expectations and opinions. In the
                    future I would be inclined to include user testing on more
                    projects, both personal and other assignments.

                    I have seen how easy it is to overlook implementation
                    details in the planning phase. During development, in many
                    cases, we needed to create more files and functions than
                    what we initially imagined. For example, to make the
                    frontpage elements display nicely on narrow screens, both
                    media queries and flexboxes were utilized. Additionally, we
                    seemed to underestimate what functionality would be useful.
                    For instance, the amount of news posts from Anime NTNU’s
                    existing website was quite large, causing us to implement a
                    feature for showing only a subset of the posts. I believe
                    this goes to show how important it is to use a good amount
                    of time for planning, to make time and workload estimates as
                    accurate as possible.
