            <p>
                Contact person: Bernt Johan Damslora, previous leader of Anime

            <p>
                Anime NTNU is a student organization for people fond of anime
                (Japanese animation). They host open screenings of anime at
                Gløshaugen weekly.

            <header><h2>The website's purpose and goals</h2></header>
            <p>
                The purpose of this website is to promote Anime NTNU and recruit
                new members. It should be easier for potential new members, as
                well as established members, to look up screenings. The website
                should also have a clear layout and be made in such a way that
                it is intuitive to use by both old and new members. In this
                context, the website should provide a good solution for sorting
                the information being displayed on the website.
            </p>

            <header><h2>Audience</h2></header>
            <p>
                The audience is all people fond of or curious about anime. As
                Anime NTNU is a voluntary student organization at NTNU, the main
                portion of the audience will consist of students at NTNU. Most
                visitors will therefore be young, which means we can keep the
                font size small in favor of other content. Furthermore, those
                who visit the website are most likely looking for information
                about Anime NTNU itself or their screenings. This is why we have
                made the decision of having a front page with different
                elements, showcasing the information that would be the most
                relevant for the audience. Lastly, Anime NTNU has a record of
                attracting international students and the site will therefore be
                made in English.
            </p>

            <header><h2>Content and organization</h2></header>
            <p>
                At the top of the website there should be a navbar with
                hyperlinks which redirects the user to different pages. This
                navbar should be easily accessible from all pages. In addition,
                there should be a button or some type of link which redirects
                the user to Anime NTNU’s Discord server, which is Anime NTNU’s
                main platform for communication. This feature will be
                implemented in the navbar according to the client's wish.
            </p>
            <p>
                Initially, when the user visits Anime NTNU, the first thing the
                user will be able to see is the front page of the website. This
                page will display some information about the next planned
                screening, a little bit about the organization, and the latest
                news post.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the bottom of the page there should be a standard footer
                containing the organization's name.
            </p>
            <p>
                There will be 4 distinct pages the user can navigate between on
                the website: the Frontpage, the Newsfeed page, the Screenings
                page, and the Who are we/Contact us page. By clicking on the
                logo in the navbar, the user will be redirected to the website’s
                frontpage.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Frontpage - This section will act as the first page a user
                    sees when visiting the organization's website. The front
                    page should contain elements from the other pages such as
                    "This week's screening", "Latest news", and an informal box
                    about Anime NTNU. These elements will give the visitor of
                    Anime NTNU a preview of what kind of information they can
                    find on the webpage, and prompt them to check out the other
                    pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Newsfeed - This section should include news items with
                    information about Anime NTNU, written by the moderators of
                    the page. The concept of the newsfeed page is made with the
                    intention of being able to post exciting announcements as
                    well as keeping members (both old and new) informed about
                    situations which will affect Anime NTNU. This page will use
                    placeholder news items for the time being.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Screenings - This section should include calendar
                    information about screenings hosted by Anime NTNU. Thus the
                    visitor will be able to stay up-to-date with all the
                    upcoming screenings happening on Gløshaugen. The page will
                    use placeholder images to display the viewing-information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Voting - This section should include a list of series that
                    are being considered as part of the current semester’s
                    program. The user should be able to rank these according to
                    which series they most want to watch. As the voting period
                    for the semester is already over, this page will only
                    contain sample information.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Who are we / Contact us - This section should include
                    information about the organization. There should be some
                    general information about the organization’s goals and
                    activities, as well as current leadership of the
                    organization. There should also be information regarding how
                    to contact the organization.

                        The website should have a horizontal navbar at the top
                        of the page with hyperlinks that lets the user navigate
                        between the different pages.

                    <li>The website should show a plan for screenings.</li>
                    <li>
                        There should be a clickable link/button on the navbar as
                        well as on the "Who are we" page which opens Anime
                        NTNU’s discord server in a new page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        At the start of each semester, you should be able to
                        vote for which series you would like to watch that
                        semester. The voting should be in the form of a ranked
                        list.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The website should have a news feed where the website’s
                        moderators can generate and publish new posts. This
                        feature will not be fully functional as of now. In the
                        future, we could properly implement this feature by
                        setting up a database for storing the associated
                        information.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        You should be able to create a user on the website. This
                        feature will also not be fully functional as of now, but
                        it’s important to have the fields in place for later
                        usage.

                    <li>
                        The horizontal navbar should be positioned so that it
                        will only be visible when the user is on the top of the
                        page.

                    <li>
                        The website should respond quickly to user navigation.

                    <li>
                        The user should be able to access any page in one click.

                    <li>
                        It should be easy to find information about screenings.

                There is a possibility that the website will be used by Anime
                NTNU after this project has been completed. In that case, the
                client would like to have the website running on the same server
                as the current one, which is hosted by NTNU. In case this is not
                possible, we’ve gotten confirmation from another student
                organization, Programvareverkstedet (PVV), that they can host
                the website instead.
