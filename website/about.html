                        Anime NTNU is a student organization for students and
                        other people who are fond of anime (Japanese animation)
                        or would like to give it a try. We host open screenings
                        of anime weekly at Gl√∏shaugen. Our screenings take place
                        on Wednesdays at 19:30, usually in

                        At the beginning of each semester, we hold a poll which
                        decides which anime will be screened throughout the
                        semester. What anime is in the poll is based on
                        suggestions from the audience and culled to a reasonable
                        amount. We usually end up watching four 1-cour (12-13
                        episodes) and one 2-cour (24-26 episodes) anime each
                        semester.

                        Due to the ongoing pandemic, our screenings are
                        currently held digitally. For more infomation about how
                        we're handling screenings this semester, check out our
