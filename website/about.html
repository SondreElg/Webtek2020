                        Anime NTNU is a student organization for students and other people who are fond of anime (Japanese animation) or would like to give it a try.
                        We host open screenings of anime weekly at Gl√∏shaugen.
                        Our screenings take place on Wednesdays at 19:30, usually in <a href="https://bit.ly/34wlaOV" target="blank">R5 at "Realfagsbygget"</a>.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        At the beginning of each semester, we hold a poll which decides which anime will be screened throughout the semester.
                        What anime is in the poll is based on suggestions from the audience and culled to a reasonable amount.
                        We usually end up watching four 1-cour (12-13 episodes) and one 2-cour (24-26 episodes) anime each semester.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        Due to the ongoing pandemic, our screenings are currently held digitally.
                        For more infomation about how we're handling screenings this semester, check out our Discord.
